# Assignment 7&mdash;Continuous integration, Git branches, and testing

## EARLY DRAFT

This assignment demonstrates the combined use of several distinct but related tools:

* **Git branches**, which support development along multiple independent  paths, by one or several developers;
* **Static checking**, which ensures that a system's code conforms to syntax, style, and safety requirements;
* **Testing frameworks**, which support accumulating a consistent and broad test suite;
* **Development platforms**, such as GitHub, which provide a central site to merge branches; and
* **Continuous integration**, which reduce the risk that merged changes introduce defects.

This list is incompleteâ€”each of these tools supports additional use cases and outcomes, while other tools are also used to achieve the above goals.

`flake8` Syntax and style changing.


## Step 1: Add your changes

~~~bash
/home/k8s # cd ci/v1.1
/home/k8s/ci/v1.1 # mv a7_music.py music.py
/home/k8s/ci/v1.1 # mv a7_test_music.py test_music.py
/home/k8s/ci/v1.1 # cd ../../s2/v1.1
/home/k8s/s2/v1.1 # mv a7_app.py app.py
~~~

* Run it locally
* Commit and push and watch

## Step 2:  Add `other_dev`'s changes

~~~bash
/home/k8s/ci/v1.1 # git checkout -b other_dev HEAD~
/home/k8s/ci/v1.1 # ls
~~~

You've rolled back time!

Do the same operations, but with `a7_other_dev_*` files.

~~~bash
/home/k8s/ci/v1.1 # mv a7_other_dev_music.py music.py
/home/k8s/ci/v1.1 # mv a7_other_dev_test_music.py test_music.py
/home/k8s/ci/v1.1 # cd ../../s2/v1.1
/home/k8s/s2/v1.1 # mv a7_other_dev_app.py app.py
~~~

* Run it locally
* Commit and push and watch

## Interlude: The levels of the CI tests

This is where we talk about structure, right?

* `runci-local.sh v1.1` (bash) Top-level script
  * `docker` (Go) Client
    * `dockerd` (Go) Server managing container images
  * `runci.sh` (bash) Mid-level script
    * `flake8` (Python) Static code checker
    * `docker-compose` (Go) Manage services and networks
      * `ci_test` (Python) Application running `pytest` framework
        * `test_music` (Python)) Test collection
          * `music.py` (Python) Client library for Music service
            * [via HTTP] `ci_s2` (Python) Music service
              * [via HTTP] `ci_db` (Python) Database interface layer
                * [via HTTP] `DynamoDB` (Java) Data storage layer

But note that we only have to attend to our layer, the one above it, and the one below.

## Step 3: Merge your changes with `other_dev`'s changes

~~~bash
/home/k8s # git checkout master
/home/k8s # git merge other_dev
~~~

Do the drill:

* Run it locally
* Commit and push and watch

Anything more?  See any possible problems?  Anything missing?

## The solution

Seriously&mdash;think about this!

## Step 4: Write a test that calls both

Use a song with multiple previous artists.

~~~python
def test_full_cycle(mserv):
    # `mserv` is an instance of the `Music` class

    # Performance at 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics
    song = ('k. d. lang', 'Hallelujah')
    # Soundtrack of first Shrek film (2001)
    orig_artist = 'Rufus Wainwright'
    # Original recording from album "Various Positions" (1984)
    orig_orig_artist = 'Leonard Cohen'

    # Create a music record and save its id in the variable `m_id`
    # ... Fill in the test ...

    # The last statement of the test
    mserv.delete(m_id)
~~~

And ... we do the drill again:

* Run it locally
* Commit and push and watch

And here I go, aiming for inspiration. Fatigued, not doing things.

The layers.  The purpose of this assignment:

* Show the connection between

GitHub is the tool where

* Continuous integration integrates and does and is
* Testing, that thing, occurs
* Branches are integrated. The work of multiple developers are
  integrated and tested.
* GitHub is where the action is
