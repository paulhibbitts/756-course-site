## Viewing/Reading

1. [The Missing Introduction To Containerization](https://medium.com/faun/the-missing-introduction-to-containerization-de1fbb73efc5)
2. [Optional: Kubernetes Podcast, episode 70: Windows Server Containers (time-mark 6m28s)](https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/070-windows-server-containers/)

## Key points


    The first article (and mandatory reading for this week) covers the history of container technology including Docker. The notable omission is Microsoft's recent contributions around Docker for Windows. The article gets into the weeds of historical Linux/Unix technologies and run-time detail that are of no interest for us.

    The second "reading" is optional and fills in on Microsoft's contribution. It is available both as a podcast for you to listen to (~30 min) as well as a transcript. (I recommend the podcast.)


## Skip altogether:

    The sections in the first article where the author asks you to download CGroup Tools: “Let’s Create a Container Using Namespaces and Groups” and to install runC: “runC: Leveraging libcontainer Without Using Docker”
