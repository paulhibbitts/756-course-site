## Reading 3

1. [The Missing Introduction To Containerization](https://medium.com/faun/the-missing-introduction-to-containerization-de1fbb73efc5)
2. [Kubernetes Podcast, episode 70: Windows Server Containers (start from ~-32m28s)](https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/070-windows-server-containers/)
3. [Makefiles in 2019 — Why They Still Matter](https://tech.trivago.com/2019/12/20/makefiles-in-2019-why-they-still-matter/)

## Key points

The first article covers the early history of container technology up to and including Docker for Linux. The notable omission is Microsoft's recent contributions around Docker for Windows. The article gets into the weeds of historical Linux/Unix technologies and run-time detail that are of no interest for us.

The second "reading" is a podcast that fills in on Microsoft's recent contribution to Docker. It is available both as an audio podcast to listen to (~30 min) or as a transcript to read. (I recommend the podcast.)

The final article focuses on a specific tool--`make`--that we have already used extensively in this course. Both the author and I have found Makefile to be a particularly powerful way to learn, operate and document complex systems operated by multiple tools. The article offers some background and useful examples that are similar and/or consistent with our usage in this course. 


## Skip altogether:

The sections in the first article where the author asks you to download CGroup Tools: “Let’s Create a Container Using Namespaces and Groups” and to install runC: “runC: Leveraging libcontainer Without Using Docker”
