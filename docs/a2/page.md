## Introduction

You will be exercising a few cloud providers within this course using educational or
demonstration credits offered by the providers. You may choose to use a regular/personal
account (especially for AWS) but this is not strictly necessary.  

Please fill in one copy of this consent form for each cloud vendor, generate a PDF,
and submit the three PDFs in a zip file for this exercise.


## Amazon Web Services

We will be using AWS in a limited capacity due to [Starter account restrictions](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awseducate-starter-account-services/AWS_Educate_Starter_Accounts_and_AWS_Services.pdf). We will use DynamoDB throughout the exercises and the term project.
If you have a personal AWS account, you may choose to use it. The cost incurred
for DynamoDB will be minimal. Doing so will also give you the EKS option for Exercise 4-7.

1. Download and fill in the [SFU consent form](https://canvas.sfu.ca/files/14721377/download?download_frd=1) in consideration of Amazon Web Service. (You are required to fill in one form for each cloud provider.) If you do not agree with the terms, please contact the instructor/TA to make alternate arrangements.

2. Apply for a 'starter' account by navigating to [Exercise 1B (AWS starter account)](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/59479/assignments/605134). You will fill in a form with AWS Educate and also accept
AWS' own consent form. Watch for an approval email from AWS Educate to confirm the account and set a password.

3. Login to [AWS Educate](https://www.awseducate.com) and continue to create your AWS Starter account. The AWS
Starter account is pre-filled with $100 of credit suitable for coursework. It has severe limitations (see above) but is otherwise useful for the course.


### Microsoft Azure

1. Download and fill in the [SFU consent form](https://canvas.sfu.ca/files/14792646/download?download_frd=1) in consideration of Microsoft Azure. (You are required to fill in one form for each cloud provider.) If you do not agree with the terms, please contact the instructor/TA to make alternate arrangements.

2. Apply for the credit at the [student portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/). You must use your sfu.ca email address to qualify for this academic credit.


### Google Cloud Platform

1. Download and fill in the [SFU consent form](https://canvas.sfu.ca/files/14792647/download?download_frd=1) in consideration of Google Cloud Platform. (You are required to fill in one form for each cloud provider.) If you do not agree with the terms, please contact the instructor/TA to make alternate arrangements.

2. Sign up for a GCP id if you do not have a Google id already.

3. Create a project within your id.

   All GCP resources are assigned to a project.  You can name your
   project anything. A good default is `c756proj`.  Leave the
   organization to its default "No Organization".

4. Enable the Containers API for your project

   Select the project you created.  Then
   [enable the Kubernetes Engine API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/container.googleapis.com/overview)
   (confusingly called `container.googleapis.com` in the URLs) for that
   project.

5. Refer to the email sent separately to your SFU address for detailed instruction on requesting a coupon code. This application *must* use your sfu.ca email address. You will receive a coupon that can be applied to your GCP id from step 2 above.


## Submission

Collect your three consent forms and package them into a zip file

Your zip file must be named according to the pattern ``<SFU_ID>-e1a-submission.zip`` where ``<SFU_ID>`` is the portion of your email address before the ``@sfu.ca``.

**A penalty will be assessed for failure to name your submission appropriately.**

### Canvas submission

Navigate to this exercise and upload the zip file.
