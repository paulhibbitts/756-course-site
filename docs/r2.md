## Key points

   This week's set of readings is centered on software development tooling. The timing for this topic is deliberate because our work with cloud and distributed systems is easily manageable with the appropriate tooling.

   If you haven't used a version control or "software configuration" tool previously, now's the time to learn one (e.g., git) and understand the practice. Data science is rapdily moving towards this standard practice with the emergence of MLops, Gitops, etc. Centralized SCM may be foreign to some but they are the established category and present in most (if not all) larger organizations. 
   
   Most students have likely used git/GitHub. Despite the prominence of this pairing, git is but one of many available tools that takes this approach. Similarly, GitHub is similarly not the only sole online repo for git. Indeed, SFU hosts its own GitLab server (at [https://csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/](https://csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/)) to provide a PIPEDA-compliant option.  
   
   The second article compares and contrasts the pattern for organizing the artifacts of a system. Even though the example is presented from git's perspective, the pattern is generalizable to other SCM tools. 
   
   Finally, the last article provides an elaboration on the pattern of "Infrastructure-as-Code". This is a superficially simple but subtley profound practice that underlies the modern approach to developing for and operating distributed systems in the public cloud.
