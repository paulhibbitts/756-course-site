## Key points

   This week's readings is centered on software development tooling. The timing for this topic is deliberate because our work with cloud and distributed systems requires you to manage a mass of details and dependencies. 

   My hypotheses are:

   1. If you haven't used a version control or "software configuration" tool previously, now's the time to learn one (git) and understand the practice. Data science and engineering as applications of software engineering require fluency with this standard practice.
   2. Most (all?) students have likely used git/GitHub. Despite the prominence of this pairing, git is but one of many available tools. Moreover, it is an exemplar of the distributed approach to SCM. The first article introduces centralized systems which you will find in many larger/established organizations. 
   3. Aside from the architectural style of the SCM tool, the second article highlights the pattern for organizing the artifacts of a system. Even though the example is presented from git's perspective, the pattern is generalizable.
   4. We will use many CLI tools within this course. I have found Makefile to be a particular convenient way to both learn and operate a collection of tools. The article provides background and useful examples that are consistent with my usage of Makefile in this course. To be clear, we will not be using make to compile/build a program. Rather, we will use make to invoke sequences of command in an organized manner.
